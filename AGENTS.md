STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Always use latest TypeScript syntax
- Always do minimal changes to the codebase to achieve the task
- Always write production-grade code
- Always only write what is needed right now. Keep all your edits as minimal and
  concise as possible to perform a task. Always start by a small research and
  implementation plan, proceed only after confirmation
- Never write your plan when requested to do something, do it right away
- Never write any comments
- Never use single-letter variables, instead use only descriptive names. This applies to all variables including lambda arguments
- Never create relay/empty functions
- Never create index.ts files with just re-exports, use them as a core code of a feature folder
- Never write "just in case" code which is not necessary (such as extra nullifying)

STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE COMMIT CONVENTIONS:
- Always use `feat: message` for new features. Never add "implement" or "add", write the feature right after feat:
- Always use `fix: message` for bug fixes. Never add "fix", write the bug right after fix:
- Always use `chore: message` for chore updates. Never add "update", write the chore right after chore:
- Always write short commit messages that are easy to understand and explain the changes
- Never describe every single change in the commit message, write only a general description of all changes
